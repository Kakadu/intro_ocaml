# The Robbers' Problem

 

Three men robbed a gentleman of a vase, containing 24 ounces of balsam.
Whilst running away they met a glass-seller, of whom they purchased three
vessels. On reaching a place of safety they wished to divide the booty, but
found that their vessels contained 5, 11 and 13 ounces respectively. How
could they divide the balsam into equal portions ?


One of the several solutions is as follows:

The vessels can contain        | 24 oz. | 13 oz. |  11 oz. | 5 oz.
---                            | ---    | ---    | ---     | ---
Their constents originally are | 24     | 0      |  0      | 0
First, make their contents     | 0      | 8      | 11      | 5
Second, make their contents    | 16     | 8      |  0      | 0
Third, make their contents     | 16     | 0      | 8       | 0
Fourth, make their contents    | 3      | 13     | 8       | 0
Fifth, make their contents     | 3      | 8      | 8       | 5
Lastly, make their contents    | 8      | 8      | 8       | 0
