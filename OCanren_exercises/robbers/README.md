# The Robbers' Problem

 

Three men robbed a gentleman of a vase, containing 24 ounces of balsam.
Whilst running away they met a glass-seller, of whom they purchased three
vessels. On reaching a place of safety they wished to divide the booty, but
found that their vessels contained 5, 11 and 13 ounces respectively. How
could they divide the balsam into equal portions ?


One of the several solutions is as follows:

The vessels can contain       | 24 oz. | 13 oz. |  11 oz. | 5 oz.
---                           | ---    | ---    | ---     | ---
Their constents originaly are | 24     | 0      |  0      | 0
