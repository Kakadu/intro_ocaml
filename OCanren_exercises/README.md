# How I Learnt OCanren 

After spending about two and a half months working through the OCaml
tutorials that come with the reference manual, I got a degree of familiarity
with the OCaml language, and then I  started to get my hands
on OCanren.

## My OCaml learning experience

The OCaml tutorial (Part I of the [reference manual](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/)) covers the features of the core language, such as types,
let-bindings, pattern matching, exception handling, modules and classes etc. I
also learnt the first few sections of the [language extensions](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/extn.html) chapter. When working with the tutorials,
I found it very helpful to refer to [The OCaml language](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/language.html) chapter, which presents systematically
the formal syntax and (informal) semantics of all features of the core
language. Almost for each feature that I learnt from Part I, I would go to this chapter to read about
the underlying formal syntax and semantics.

The interesting observation is that
when I learnt a natural language, e.g., English or Russian, it feels sufficient
to learn mainly by memorizing examples, and very little (perhaps < 5%) of the
time was spent on the grammar; however when learning a formal
(or computer programming) language, a deeper sense of certainty could not be
gained without reading the theory about the language itself, i.e., its syntax
and semantics (or using onw word, just grammar), although examples are still indispensable. On the other hand, I started to learn programming languages from
2010, and I learnt, in chronological order, C, C++, Matlab, Java, Haskell,
Prolog, and Scheme and OCaml. It was not until early 2020 when I started to
develop an interest in the formal syntax and semantics of the programming
language that I am learning. Before that I just learnt by examples and forgot
the syntactic details quickly after the projects finished.
