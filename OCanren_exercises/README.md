# How I Learnt OCanren 

After spending about two and a half months working through the OCaml
tutorials that come with the reference manual, I got a degree of familiarity
with the OCaml language, and then I  started to get my hands
on OCanren.

## My OCaml learning experience

The OCaml tutorial (Part I of the [reference manual](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/)) covers the features of the core language, such as types,
let-bindings, pattern matching, exception handling, modules and classes etc. I
also learnt the first few sections of the [language extensions](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/extn.html) chapter. When working with the tutorials,
I found it very helpful to refer to [The OCaml language](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/language.html) chapter, which presents systematically
the formal syntax and (informal) semantics of all features of the core
language. Almost for each feature that I learnt from Part I, I would go to this chapter to read about
the underlying formal syntax and semantics. The interesting observation is that
when I leanrt a natural language, e.g., English or Russian, it feels sufficient
to learn mainly by memorizing examples, and very little (perhaps < 5%) of the
time was spent on the grammar; however when learning a formal
(or computer programming)language, a deeper sense of certainty could not be
gained without reading the theory about the language itself, i.e., its syntax
and grammar, although examples are still indispensable.
