# The Jeep Problem 

https://mathworld.wolfram.com/JeepProblem.html 

A jeep is going to cross a desert: traveling from base A on one side
of the desert to base B on the other side. 

The jeep has a fuel tank. Suppose that the tank holds 10.67 liters of fuel
maximum and with which it can run for at most 412.6 km.
We abstract and simplify from these details.
For instance, we take 1.067 liter as one unit
of fuel and take 41.26 km as one unit of distance, and say that the jeep's 
tank has a maximum capacity of ten units of fuel, and with which it can run for
 ten units of distance. Moreover, we assume that the jeep consumes fuel and
covers distance in a discrete (or unit-by-unit) and propotional manner, where
one unit of fuel is consumed at a time and this always results in one unit of
distance covered. 

There is a fuel station in base A, providing practically unlimited
 fuel. The way between base A and B is much longer
than ten units, i.e.,  the longest distance coverable by one full tank of fuel,
 but unfortunately there is no more fuel stations along the way,
and at any time the jeep can carry at most one tank (equals ten units) of fuel.

 
The specific strategy that the jeep uses to cross the desert in this situation
is that it carries empty bottles:  on the way it could transfer some fuel 
from the tank to some bottles and leave the bottles there, thus creating 
mini fuel dumps in the desert. The jeep could refuel by going back to base 
A or from the fuel dumps. These are all assumed to be done unit-by-unit. 


The jeep problem can be formulated as: how should the jeep create dumps and 
refuel in order to complete the journey, and  what is the minimum amount of 
fuel needed by the jeep ?
