# The Jeep Problem 

https://mathworld.wolfram.com/JeepProblem.html 

A jeep is going to cross a desert: moving from base A on one side
of the desert to base B on the other side. 

The jeep has a fuel tank. We abstract from certain specifications of 
the tank. For instance,  the tank may hold 10.67 liters of fuel maximum
and with which it can run 412.6 km. We take 10.67 liters as one unit of fuel
and take 412.6 km as one unit of distance, and say that the jeep's 
tank holds one unit of fuel, and with which it can run for one unit of 
distance.

There is a fuel station in base A, providing practically unlimited units 
of fuel. The distance between base A and B is much longer
than one unit, but unfortunately there is no more fuel stations along the way,
and at any time the jeep can carry at most one unit of fuel.

 
The specific strategy that jeep uses to cross the desert in this situation
is that it carries empty bottles:  on the way it could transfer some fuel 
from the tank to some bottles and leave the bottles there, thus creating 
mini fuel dumps in the desert. The jeep could refuel by going back to base 
A or from the fuel dumps.  


The jeep problem can be formulated as: how should the jeep create dumps and 
refuel in order to complete the journey, and  what is the minimum amount of 
fuel needed by the jeep ?
